## Mememan 3
Very editable copy of Mememan 3 for Chrome/Safari (soon Firefox) created with LiveScript, Processing.js and Node.js.

To host it, just clone. To customize it, download, make your changes and run `node build` on the main folder. Or just compile the LiveScript files by yourself and browserify "index.js" into an "index.html" file. New enemies and objects go on the objects folder. Add new weapons by editing mememan's object. Don't forget to link them on index.ls.
