Minimal requirements of prototype:
- Steady FPS of game, no laggy feeling.
- Menu system and general gui heavily inspired by mega man. Healthbar for hero, and powerbar for hero's special weapons.
- One playable level, with different enemies and a end-level boss. All enemies should have/show different movement patterns and attacks.
- Hero takes damage when touchin most enemies or enemies' projectiles, and certain level tiles.
- Empty hero healthbar or hero falling off screen usually equals death.
- Most of the time the game view is following. Sometimes the view is locked while the hero moves around.
- Different powerups scattered around, being dropped of dead enemies etc. Health and power for weapons. Occasionally extra lives, possibillities for making new stuff.
- Some kind of sprite-system, but again, some enemies in the prototype can just be simple shapes (rectangles, triangles, circles) as long as they move and stuff.
- Graphics should be pixelated in style, like good old NES 8-bit.
- Hero must have at least 2-3 weapons to demonstrate weapon system
- Responsive and fluent movement of hero.
- Example of sound effects/music, nothing fancy.
- Possibillites/examples of writing text (dialog text)
- Levels should be possible to define in a file.
- Movement keys should be configurable in files at least.
   Seven key inputs: <move right>, <move left>, <climb down>, <climb up>, <jump>, <shoot>, <menu/select> 
   Special move: <climb down> + <jump> = slide (short rapid forward movement) See video 1, at time 2:02
   Most weapons should always fire straight forward, but for some, one should be able to chose direction by pressing <move right/left> and <climb up/down>


Nice to have stuff:
- Would be nice if the sw architeture supports for retrieving data from the internets in the future
- Password system, like 4:58 in video 1. See video 2 for how to enter password. The password loads a state of hero: lives, levels cleared.
- Splash/intro screen
- End screen/credits example
